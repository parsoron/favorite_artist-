He also introduced young Austin to different genres of music including country, rock, and hip-hop.
      When Malone was nine, he and his family moved to Texas after his father was allotted the post of a manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>He began learning the guitar after watching the video game ‘Guitar Hero.’ In 2010, he auditioned for the American rock band ‘Crown the Empire’ but was rejected.
      At the age of 16, he created his first ever mixtape titled ‘Young and After Them Riches’ using the digital audio editor Audacity. He shared it with some of his schoolmates at the Grapevine High School and was voted <i>"Most Likely to Become Famous"</i> by them as a senior in school.</p>
     <p> As a teenager, Malone worked at a Chicken Express. He attended Tarrant County College for a while. However, he dropped out from there and moved to <b>Los Angeles, California</b> with <i>Jason Probst</i>, his friend and professional game streamer.</p>
